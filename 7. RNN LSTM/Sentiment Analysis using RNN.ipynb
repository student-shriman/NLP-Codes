Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.\n","\n","The architecture for this network is shown below.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*27JmK8VBdphpSCWNb4MhNA.png\" width=400px>\n","\n","Here, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer. We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the word2vec lesson. You can actually train up an embedding with word2vec and use it here. But it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn the embedding table on it's own.\n","\n","From the embedding layer, the new representations will be passed to LSTM cells. These will add recurrent connections to the network so we can include information about the sequence of words in the data. Finally, the LSTM cells will go to a sigmoid output layer here. We're using the sigmoid because we're trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. The output layer will just be a single unit then, with a sigmoid activation function.\n","\n","We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the very last one, we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the cost from the output of the last step and the training label."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"95CUPsICvwVF","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":128},"outputId":"2def6aae-9a3c-47a6-a805-4c2487e53de7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587556623681,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":31246,"user":{"displayName":"Neeraj Khatri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjWzHYNdQdODHYqRbqeIEzcgYkPSa0tTsA3eOXE=s64","userId":"03799805667865483283"}}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Go to this URL in a browser: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=947318989803-6bn6qk8qdgf4n4g3pfee6491hc0brc4i.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn%3aietf%3awg%3aoauth%3a2.0%3aoob&response_type=code&scope=email%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fdocs.test%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fdrive%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fdrive.photos.readonly%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fpeopleapi.readonly\n","\n","Enter your authorization code:\n","··········\n","Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LCM4qKF5RVvO","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import tensorflow as tf"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FQYO3L6ARVvW","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["with open('reviews.txt', 'r') as f:\n","    reviews = f.read()\n","with open('labels.txt', 'r') as f:\n","    labels = f.read()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SbxikOiHRVvd","colab_type":"code","outputId":"48c7d031-bc82-4397-9eb9-ed3ac8a0ad10","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":55},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587567430747,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1319,"user":{"displayName":"Neeraj Khatri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjWzHYNdQdODHYqRbqeIEzcgYkPSa0tTsA3eOXE=s64","userId":"03799805667865483283"}}},"source":["reviews[:2000]"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'bromwell high is a cartoon comedy . it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life  such as  teachers  . my   years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high  s satire is much closer to reality than is  teachers  . the scramble to survive financially  the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers  pomp  the pettiness of the whole situation  all remind me of the schools i knew and their students . when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school  i immediately recalled . . . . . . . . . at . . . . . . . . . . high . a classic line inspector i  m here to sack one of your teachers . student welcome to bromwell high . i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched . what a pity that it isn  t   \\nstory of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig . starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy . a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane  violent mob by the crazy chantings of it  s singers . unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting . even those from the era should be turned off . the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader . on a technical level it  s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond . future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly .  \\nhomelessness  or houselessness as george carlin stated  has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school  work  or vote for the matter . most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism  the war on iraq  pressuring kids to succeed  technology  the elections  inflation  or worrying if they  ll be next to end up on the streets .  br    br   but what if y'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"efSB76FERVvn","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Data preprocessing\n","\n","The first step when building a neural network model is getting your data into the proper form to feed into the network.

it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles  young frankenstein  or spaceballs for the matter  to show what it  s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don  t know what to do with their money  maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly
